# fourier_transform
This repository contains the code that can explain the construction of different waves using Fourier Series
It also contains a Jupyter Notebook (Julia Kernel) to Simulate FFT

# Running the file
The files are built on python3, so run them through the terminal/command prompt
ex: python3 triWaveGen.py

For Fourier Transform Simulation, open Jupyter notebook and run the code, but make sure about the fft.py file and install Julia before you run it
